# Beth's AI Tools
This repo contains a list of the tools I've made to make it easy to interact with OpenAI's artificial intelligences, such as GPT-3 and DALL-E.

Since the OpenAI APIs cost money, you will need to provide your own API token. The instructions below will guide you on how to do that, and how to use the tools.

**All of these were built for function, not beauty.**

# How to use
1. Create an account at: [beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup)
2. Generate an [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.
3. Open the tool you want to use and paste your API key where it asks for an API token.
4. Type in your prompt and submit it.
5. Wait for the result!

**Note:** Your token is stored locally in your web browser. It is never transmitted to me in any capacity.


# GPT-3 Chat
This tool allows you to send prompts to GPT-3, and it displays the results in the format of a text chat.

# GPT-3 Sentiment Analysis
You can technically do sentiment analysis using GPT-3 Chat, but this tool is specifically designed for it. You paste in some text, and it outputs the detected sentiment.

## DALL-E Web Interface
This tool lets you type in a prompt, and DALL-E generates an image based on your prompt. You can choose from three different resolutions, and you can also generate up to 10 images at a time.

This tool doesn't save your images for you, so make sure you save them by right clicking and selecting "Save as".
