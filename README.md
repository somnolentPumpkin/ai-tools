# Beth's AI Tools
This repo contains a list of the tools I've made to make it easy to interact with OpenAI's artificial intelligences, such as GPT-3 and DALL-E.

Since the OpenAI APIs cost money, you will need to provide your own API token, which you can get from here: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

**Note:** You will need to create an OpenAI account before you can get an API key from that link.

All you have to do is paste that API key onto the page of one of the tools where it asks, and it will remember the token so you only have to paste it in once. The token is stored in your local browser; it is never transmitted to me in any capacity.

**All of these were built for function, not beauty.**

# GPT-3 Chat
This tool allows you to send prompts to GPT-3, and it displays the results in the format of a text chat.

# GPT-3 Sentiment Analysis
You can technically do sentiment analysis using GPT-3 Chat, but this tool is specifically designed for it. You paste in some text, and it outputs the detected sentiment.

## DALL-E Web Interface
This tool lets you type in a prompt, and DALL-E generates an image based on your prompt. You can choose from three different resolutions, and you can also generate up to 10 images at a time.

This tool doesn't save your images for you, so make sure you save them by right clicking and selecting "Save as".
